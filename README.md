🚀 Exciting Personal Project Alert! 🚀

🎨 I'm thrilled to share my latest personal project with you all: a Hair Color Change App built using React.js and powered by MediaPipe's advanced hair segmentation technology! 💇‍♂️💼

As someone passionate about technology and its endless possibilities, I embarked on this journey to create a tool that combines my love for coding with my interest in the beauty industry. With this app, you can now experiment with different hair colors in real-time, right from your own device! 🌟💻

Key Features:

📸 Real-time Webcam Feed: See immediate changes as you try on different hair colors with the live video feed feature.

💡 Hair Segmentation with MediaPipe: Accurately identifies and isolates your hair in real-time, ensuring precise color overlay without affecting the background.

🎨 Interactive Color Palette: Choose from a diverse range of hair colors through an intuitive color palette interface.

🖌️ Adjustment Controls: Fine-tune your selected hair color with adjustable parameters for the perfect look.

📱 Instant Preview: Preview your selected hair color in real-time to make informed decisions before finalizing the change.

💾 Save and Share: Save snapshots or share your new look directly from the app.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: Developed using React.js for a sleek and responsive user interface.
Backend: Leveraged MediaPipe's hair segmentation model for real-time image processing.
Webcam API: Integrated with the browser's webcam API for capturing live video feed.
Styling: Customized CSS for a visually appealing user experience.
Deployment: Hosted on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for easy accessibility.
This project has been a labor of love, and I'm excited to share it with you all! It's not just about changing hair colors; it's about exploring creativity and self-expression in a whole new way. Try it out and let me know what you think! 💬💡
